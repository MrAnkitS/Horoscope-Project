# Horoscope-Project

Python GUI Application created using Tkinter Module where the user enters Date-of-birth as input (using drop-down lists), after which the zodiac-sign of the user is determined based on DOB using a simple function having conditional statements. The zodiac-sign is then passed on to the horoscope function to fetch that dayâ€™s horoscope of the passed zodiac-sign using an open-source Daily-Horoscope API. The fetched horoscope is then displayed on the application window along with the Zodiac-sign.
